# About

this is a program that should crop (trim) your video

tl;dr was just experimenting new stuff with python gui to create a program for a friend

**this code is a mess**, this is all just kinda experimental
was trying to develop with tkinter for the first time, and i actually had to do alot of stuff (probably in the worst way possible) just to make this program work
yes, i probably shouldn't have overload the videoplayer file and separate it into more modules
i do not plan to keep changing this program

# Requirements

you need ffmpeg installed on your computer

## Executable only for windows 10?

if you wish to run this program in your machine with another operating system, you can try to download the source files, install the python dependencies and run with python
if needed to compile i recommend doing so with some python module that is able to convert the files into a binary, for my case i used pyinstaller

# Credits
